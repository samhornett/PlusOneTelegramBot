# Plus one bot for the telegram music chat

Currently counts the numbers of +1 given by each user in a reply to any spotify link posted in the channel.

# TODO

Add tracking of who left links 
Add playlists 
Make the different sort of links more robust




## Troubleshooting

To run needs a secrets.json with a spotify and telegram api token inside.

Also bot needs to be an admin in the group to parse the messages
